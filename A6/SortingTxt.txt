        After trying the different algorithms, I was a little surprised they were all relatively closely fast. The smaller the data sets, the faster the algorithms will run. This was really fun to see the algorithms we learned and practiced in and out of class in action. In the decision of picking one algorithm over another, it can depend on what kind of data you are sorting and how large the data set is. For example, I have noticed that some algorithms are easier to conceptualize, but others are faster for the computer to process. Empirical analysis has its shortcomings, because although it is a more precise way of analyzing data, it is more complicated and has to run all the way through all the tests. I would guess that the language of C++ was a very beneficial language to code these tests in, because of the data structure uses and it goes well with what we learn in class about analysis and algorithms. A good thing about empirical analysis with this assignment is that you could set the same data set up to each of them and run the experiment at the same time. A challenge about is that the programmer could accidentally program one very concise and another one more complex and more lines of code by mistake. This practice with sorting algorithms allowed me to practice implementing sorting algorithms as well as doing an experimental analysis experiment.Ê
